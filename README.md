## Project overview
The data was provided by the SkilHarvest and the task was to tell a story on attrition based on employee statistics and analyze various metrics related to the workforce, such as employee attrition, performance rating, job satisfaction, etc. 

The HR Attrition Dashboard is divided into 4 namely;

Demographics- this summarizes employee statistics such as age group, gender, marital status, etc, 

Employee wellness provides insights to performance ratings, job satisfactions, work life balance.

Turnover Analysis I-this provides insights into employee attrition by job roles, years in current role, etc.

Turnover Analysis II-this features attrition by monthly income, overtime, etc.

## Data Cleaning, Preparation and Transformation

I used data groups to aggregate certain values together so as to form meaningful subsets.

For Work life balance, I created groups using lists and Grouped 1 as Bad, 2 as Average, 3 as Good and 4 as Excellent."

Job involvement is also grouped as Very low, Low, Moderate, High for values 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively

For distance from home, 1-10 is considered near, 10-20 is considered far and 20 â€“ 30 is considered very far. 

The Performance Rating column with values 3 and 4 were grouped to "Low" and "High" respectively

Job, environmental and relationship satisfaction is rated on a scale ranging from 1 to 4. 

On the satisfaction scale, 1 represents "very dissatisfied," 2 stands for "dissatisfied," 3 signifies "satisfied," and 4 indicates "very satisfied."
