## Data Cleaning, Preparation and Transformation

The data was checked for blanks and duplicates.

I went on to create data groups to aggregate certain values together so as to form meaningful subsets.

For Work life balance, I created groups using lists and Grouped 1 as Bad, 2 as Average, 3 as Good and 4 as Excellent."

Job involvement was grouped as Very low, Low, Moderate, High for values 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively

For distance from home, 1-10 is considered near, 10-20 is considered far and 20 â€“ 30 is considered very far. 

The Performance Rating column with values 3 and 4 were grouped to "Low" and "High" respectively

Job, environmental and relationship satisfaction was rated on a scale ranging of 1 to 4. 

On the satisfaction scale, 1 represents "very dissatisfied," 2 stands for "dissatisfied," 3 signifies "satisfied," and 4 indicates "very satisfied."
