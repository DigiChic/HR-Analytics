## Project overview
This project is to tell a story on attrition based on employee statistics and analyze various metrics related to the 

workforce, such as employee attrition, performance rating, job satisfaction, etc. 


### The project insight is divided into 4 namely;

- Demographics- this summarizes employee statistics such as age group, gender, marital status, etc, 

- Employee wellness provides insights to performance ratings, job satisfactions, work life balance.

- Turnover Analysis I shows employee attrition by job roles, departments, years in current role, etc.

- Turnover Analysis II shows attrition by monthly income, overtime, etc.

## Data Sources

## Data Cleaning, Preparation and Transformation

The data was checked for blanks and duplicates.

- I went on to create data groups to aggregate certain values together so as to form meaningful subsets.

- For Work life balance, I created groups using lists and Grouped 1 as Bad, 2 as Average, 3 as Good and 4 as Excellent."

- Job involvement was grouped as Very low, Low, Moderate, High for values 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively

- For distance from home, 1-10 is considered near, 10-20 is considered far and 20 – 30 is considered very far. 

- The Performance Rating column with values 3 and 4 were grouped to "Low" and "High" respectively

- Job, environmental and relationship satisfaction was rated on a scale ranging of 1 to 4. 

- On the satisfaction scale, 1 represents "very dissatisfied," 2 stands for "dissatisfied," 3 signifies "satisfied," and 4 indicates "very satisfied."
